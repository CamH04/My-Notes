# Stored Functions vs Procedures
Procedures 

*   runs as a unit
    
*   changes database objects while taking no parameters
    
*   do not return result
    

Stored Functions 

*   runs in the computers memory
    
*   cant change anything and take parameters
    
*   return result
    

Using procedures saves memory due to not having to load the data into memory

Stored procedures join SQL queries with incoming data to communicate with outside software
