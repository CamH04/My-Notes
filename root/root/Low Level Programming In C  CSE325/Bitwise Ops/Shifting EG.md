# Shifting EG
Bitwise OPS
-----------

`uint8_t a = 6;`

`uint8_tb = 0;`

`b = a << 3;`Â 

b would be = 48

as 6 in binary = 110

then we left shift by 3 = 110000

**Same applies if shifting to right just move bits the other way lol**

The Maths Of Shifting
---------------------

Shifting to Left works as such:

a \* 2^(number of shifts)

Shifting to Right works as such:

a / 2^(number of shifts)
