# a very gallant gentleman
To go outside

In more than a bitter wind

The storm screeches on

As hunger sets in

“I am going outside, i may be some time”

Oh, the perfection of a heartless snow is utterly sublime

Sir Oates steps outside to a misery bound fate, all set for him

Sir Oates, a sacrifice made by one very gallant gentleman
