        <p>C++ expects a stack pointer before the program is executed, that is a
          big problem as the boot loader wont set it. That means we have to set it
          yourself. In AlbaOS this is done in as follows:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>loader.s :</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;">sets stack pointer and then jumps to kernel.cpp</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For this ^ to work we will need to use a linker (.ld file) because they
          are different languages (ASM and C++). These files are combined to create
          the kernel.bin file</p>
        <p>The kernel.bin is put into the boot directory of the partition as well
          as putting a menu entry for it into the GRUB .CFG so the boot loader can
          be pointed to the kernel.</p>
