# Borrowing
Aka , creating a reference:

Because the reference borrows access to the data from the owner without taking ownership of the data

Mutable refers to the ability to mutate the data

**Rule 1: At any point, you can have 1 mutable ref OR as many immutable references**

**Rule 2: References must be to valid / allocated memory**
