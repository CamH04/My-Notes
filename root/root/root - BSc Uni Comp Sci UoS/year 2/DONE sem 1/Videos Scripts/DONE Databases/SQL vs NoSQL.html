        <p>Key Value Based NoSQL system vs SQL based systems</p>
        <p>What is a document store db. A db that stores / retrieves data as documents,
          much like a text document with multiple key value pairs within a document</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:40px;">I also prefer a document store model compared to a key value system as
          it allows for the storage of embedded documents&nbsp;</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Mongo Db dwarf usage (43) , 2nd highest being mySQL (22)</li>
            <li>Sql v noSQl isnt about relational v non relational. Its about the debate
              of the importatnce of ACID properties wihtin a DBMS (atomism, consistency,
              isolation, and durability.)NoSQl says its useless and provides the CAP
              theory insted as proposed by Professor Eric Brewer (consistency, availability,
              and partition tolerance)</li>
            <li>I think that the CAP theroy is much more relevent in todays world due
              to the persistance of big data
              <br>and its important role in socity,</li>
            <li>CAP lends itself to big data much more effectivly due to its relative
              flexibility especialy when compared
              <br>to the extreamly constrictive nature of a SQL / Relational System due
              to them utalising acid transaction systems</li>

          <p>In Conclution Pharagraph:
            <br>5. These NoSQL data models are understandable and simple to execute and
            do not involve complicated methods for SQL optimization in Big Data analysis
            <br>6. ^ this point is especily one to take into consideration due to the
            importance of optimisation of the database in a big data system</p>
          <ol>
            <li>But this all leads back to the point that ACID transactions do provide
              more security esspecialy in which the situations reqire alot less of a
              complex data store model than big data databases</li>
            <li>Due to document / key value based systems not having a standered query
              language , data lookup can become obtuse within smaller systems</li>
            <li>But document / key value store NoSQL database systems allow for nested
              documents and arrays without having to worry about data redundency</li>
          </ol>

          <p>So for such an example i would use an sql database due to its security
            in data redundancy and duplication when properly implemented.</p>
