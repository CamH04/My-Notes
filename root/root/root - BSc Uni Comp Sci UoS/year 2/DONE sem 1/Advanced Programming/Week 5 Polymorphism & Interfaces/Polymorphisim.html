        <p>Overriding a method within a class</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Polymorphism refers to the ability to have a method inherited by parent
            classes but
            <br>having it do different things â€“ one method, many uses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Virtual , Abstract&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The override modifier is required to extend or modify an inherited abstract
            or virtual
            <br>method or property.
            <br>&nbsp;- Abstract methods do not have an implementation, forcing the derived
            classes to override
            <br>them.
            <br>- Virtual methods have an implementation, giving derived classes the option
            of overriding
            <br>them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Method redefinition occurs when an inherited method in a derived class
          intends to hide
          <br>rather than extend the base class method of the same name.
          <br>Where the override modifier extends the base class method, the new modifier
          hides it.</p>
