        <p>The Secure Hash Algorithms
          <br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>SHA uses a series of bitwise operations, modular additions, and compression
          functions to process the input data and generate the hash</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>SHA1, SHA2 and SHA3:</u>
          <br>SHA1 discontinued after 2010 – 160bits
          <br>SHA2 developed by the NSA in 2001 – Still in use in things like TLS and
          SSL
          <br>224, 256, 384, or 512 bits
          <br>SHA3 published in 2016 after attacks against MD5 and SHA1 were shown (Same
          lengths as SHA2)</p>
