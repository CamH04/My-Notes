        <p>We now have an admin user name and password. Lets see what other credentials
          we can get, and what access we can get to that tzab3 database.</p>
        <p>On the kali terminal, type:<strong>mysql -h 192.168.100.60 -u admin –p</strong>Enter
          the password sunderland</p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><strong>use tzab3;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><strong>select * from users;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We now have access to all these usernames and passwords, though all hashed
          again. There are some tools online that could help though. Copy the hash
          for one of the users, and go to https://crackstation.net/ - copy in the
          hash. – Do you get the password for that user? What do you think we could
          do with this information?</p>
