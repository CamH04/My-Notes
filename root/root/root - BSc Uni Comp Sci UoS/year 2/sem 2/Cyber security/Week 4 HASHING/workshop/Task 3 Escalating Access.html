        <p>The previous stage we should have found some logon credentials for the
          database. These are likely an individual users credentials, and wont have
          access to the administration options we want, or all the data we want.
          So lets fix that.</p>
        <p>On kali, open a terminal window and type</p>
        <p><strong>mysql -h 192.168.100.60 -u wordpress -p</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Enter the password we found.</p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><strong>SHOW DATABASES;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Have a look at what we have found. The tzab3 database looks like it may
          contain some interesting information, and at the very least we should have
          some access to the wordpress database.</p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><strong>use tzab3;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Did it work? Why not? Type:</p>
        <p><strong>use wordpress;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Type:</p>
        <p><strong>select * from wp_users;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This is interesting, there is an admin username and password. Get both.
          The password has been hashed, but this is not a big deal. Hashing can be
          undone. Particularly if it is a simple password. One method is to create
          a list of possible passwords (a dictionary) and hash them using the same
          method as has been used by the database. If a hash matches the hash we
          have, then thatâ€™s the password. We will assume we have done this for the
          remainder of the exercise (though, see if you can write a program to do
          that if you want!)</p>
