        <p>Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serial, Async</li>
          <li>2 lines , one recive one send</li>
          <li>The receiver must lock onto the data and detect individual bits</li>
          <li>starts with a starting bit, usually by driving
            <br>logic low for one clock cycle. In the next n clock cycles, n bits are
            sent
            <br>sequentially from the transmitter until a stop bit is sent</li>
          <li>Char is 8 bits usualy</li>
          <li>Can have a parity bit:
            <ul>
              <li>Parity can be set to "odd" or "even," and it ensures that the total number
                of bits set to
                <br>logic "1" in a character is either even or odd</li>
