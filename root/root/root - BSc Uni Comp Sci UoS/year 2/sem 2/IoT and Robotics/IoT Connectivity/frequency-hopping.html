        <p>rapidly switch between several pre-defined channels within the band</p>
        <p>eg :&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the 2.4 GHz band is divided into 79 (Bluetooth Classic) or 40 (Bluetooth
          Low
          <br>Energy)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hopping Sequence: Both devices agree on a synchronized "hopping sequence,"
          a predetermined order in which they jump between channels</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Short Packets: Data is transmitted in small packets, further reducing
          the chance of
          <br>interference within any single channel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adaptive Hopping: This means devices can dynamically avoid channels experiencing
          interference</p>
