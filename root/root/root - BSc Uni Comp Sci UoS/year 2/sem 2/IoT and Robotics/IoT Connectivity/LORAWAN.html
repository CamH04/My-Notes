        <p>LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), low power long range</p>
        <p>sub-GHz frequency bands, such as 868 MHz in
          <br>Europe and 915 MHz in North America</p>
        <p>Up to several KM's</p>
        <p>pread-spectrum modulation technique called chirp spread spectrum (CSS),
          which allows it to transmit data over long distances while consuming very
          little power</p>
        <p>encryption and
          <br>authentication</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>star-of-stars topology in
          <br>which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network
          server</p>
        <p>gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections
          and act as a transparent bridge, simply converting RF packets to
          <br>IP packets and vice versa.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEVICES:</p>
        <p>• Class A devices are the most common and consume the least amount of
          <br>power. They have a simple communication scheme, where they can
          <br>transmit data to the gateway at any time, but can only receive data from
          <br>the gateway immediately after a transmission.
          <br>• Class B devices have an additional receive window, where they can
          <br>receive data from the gateway at specific times, providing improved
          <br>network performance.
          <br>• Class C devices have a continuously open receive window, allowing them
          <br>to receive data from the gateway at any time, but consume more power
          <br>than Class A and B devices.</p>
